# WordGuessTemplate

This was the final Project of UIC's CS342:Software Design course.  It was a team collaborated effort of 4 people. The project is a multithreated Word guessing game similar to HangMan.

In this project I was personaly responsible for the implementation of the Server/Client communication as well as the design and flow of the UI/UX.

The Project Writeup was included for reference.
